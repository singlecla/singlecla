# Single CLA

Version 1.0.0-pre.8

## Purpose

This contributor license agreement, or CLA, sets out the terms and guarantees that I give for my contributions to others' projects.  That way they can accept my contributions without fear of licensing problems, and I can sign a single CLA, rather than one for each project.

## Scope

This section makes clear when this CLA applies to my contributions.

### Pull Requests

This CLA applies to every pull request that I open offering a contribution:

1.  to a public software repository

2.  on the same website where I published this CLA

3.  for a project that gathers rights to license contributions in a single organization or individual, the project steward, such as a foundation, company, or lead developer

### Exceptions

This CLA does _not_ apply to a pull request if I specifically say it does not in a comment to that pull request.  For example, I might say:

> My Single CLA does not apply to this pull request.

### Withdrawal

This CLA does _not_ apply to any pull request that I open after removing this signed CLA from the `singlecla` repository of my account.

## Licensing

This section assures project stewards that my contributions come under acceptable license terms.

### Others' Work

When I make contributions including others' work:

1.  I promise to take basic steps to make sure that work is licensed under standard terms [certified by Blue Oak Council and rated "bronze" or better](https://blueoakcouncil.org/list).

2.  I promise to include copies of copyright notices, license terms, and other licensing documentation in my contribution, so the project steward can tell from files in the project's repository who licensed what work under what terms.

### My Own Work

When I make contributions of my own work:

1.  I license the project steward to do everything with my work that would otherwise infringe all copyrights in it that I can license.

2.  I license the project steward to do everything with my work that would otherwise infringe any patent claims that I can license.

3.  These license grants cover copyrights and patent claims I can license at the time I open my pull request, as well as copyrights and patent claims I become able to license later.

4.  I license the project steward to pass these rights on to, or sublicense, anyone or everyone, under any terms they choose, one or many times.  As examples, this covers releasing the project on new public license terms, as well as licensing the project to specific customers on commercial license terms.

5.  I cannot and will not revoke these license grants.

6.  ***As far as the law allows, my work comes as is, without any warranty or condition, apart from my promises about [right to license](#right-to-license) under this CLA.***

## Right to License

This section assures project stewards that I actually have the legal right to contribute the work I offer.

### All Work

When I make a contribution, I promise that all the work in it will be covered by this CLA, either as [others' work](#others-work) or as [my own work](#my-own-work).

### Awareness

I am aware of legal rules, like ["work made for hire"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire) rules, that can give employers and clients ownership of intellectual property in work that I do.  I am also aware that legal agreements I make [can transfer ownership of intellectual property in my work to others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(law)), such as companies I found or sell my work to.  I am aware that in either case, someone else owns the legal rights in work that I do.

### Permission

When I offer a contribution with permission from some other company or person who might own legal rights in it, I promise to mention all the following in comments to my pull request:

1.  the fact that someone else might own legal rights in my contribution

2.  the name of the person or organization who might own the legal rights

3.  whether and how they gave me permission to contribute

### Company and Client CLAs

If a project steward asks me to help get a CLA from someone who many own legal rights in my contribution, I promise to help the project steward request that CLA.  I am aware that individuals with signature authority can sign CLAs for companies and other legal entities.

## Reliability

I fully expect project stewards, users, and distributors to rely on this CLA.  I am aware that they might enforce this CLA as a legally binding agreement.

## Signature
