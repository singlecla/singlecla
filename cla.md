# Single CLA

Version 2.0.0

## Purpose

This contributor license agreement spells out how I license contributions to public software projects on this website.  That way projects can accept my contributions without fear of licensing problems and I can sign one contributor license agreement for all projects here, rather than one for each project.

## Pull Requests Covered

This CLA applies to every pull request that I open offering a contribution:

1.  on the same website where I published this CLA in the `singlecla` repository under my account name

2.  to a public software repository

3.  for a project that gathers rights to license contributions in a single project steward, such as a foundation, company, or lead developer

This CLA also applies to a pull request if I specifically say it applies in a comment to that pull request.  For example, I might say:

> My Single CLA applies to this pull request.

## Exceptions

This CLA does _not_ apply to a pull request if I specifically say it does not apply in a comment to that pull request before it is accepted.  For example, I might say:

> My Single CLA does not apply to this pull request.

## Withdrawing My CLA

This CLA does _not_ apply to any pull request that I open on this website after removing this signed CLA from the `singlecla` repository under my account name.

## Licensing My Work

When I open pull requests offering contributions of work that I have the legal right to license:

1.  I license the project steward to do everything with my work that would otherwise infringe all copyrights in it that I can license.

2.  I license the project steward to do everything with my work that would otherwise infringe any patents that I can license.

3.  I license the project steward to do everything with my work that would otherwise infringe any database rights in it that I can license.

4.  These license grants cover rights I can license at the time I open my pull request and rights I become able to license later.

5.  I license the project steward to pass these rights on to, or sublicense, anyone or everyone, under any terms they choose, one or many times.  This covers releasing the project under new public license terms, as well as licensing the project to specific customers on commercial license terms.

6.  As far as the law allows, I waive any moral rights I have in the work.

7.  I cannot and will not revoke these license grants or waivers.

8.  ***As far as the law allows, my work comes as is, without any warranty or condition.***

## Work I Have Permission to Contribute

When I open pull requests offering contributions of work that companies or other organizations, like my employers or clients, might have the legal right to license, I promise to mention all the following in comments to those pull requests:

1.  the fact that the organization might have the legal right to license work I am offering

2.  the name of the organization

3.  whether and how they gave me permission to contribute

For example, I might say:

> I did this work while on the job for Example, Inc.  They may have the legal right to license it, instead of me.  I asked my manager if I could contribute my work, and she pointed me to our company's open source policy, which covers it.

## Other Work

When I open pull requests offering contributions including work that others have the legal right to license:

1.  I promise to mention in comments to those pull requests when that work isn't clearly licensed under permissive open license terms that Blue Oak Council rates "bronze" or better at <https://blueoakcouncil.org/list>.

2.  I promise to include copies of copyright notices, license terms, and other licensing documentation in my pull request, so the project steward can tell from files in the project's repository who licensed what work under what terms.

## Work Made For Hire, IP Assignments, and So On

I am aware of legal rules, like ["work made for hire"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire) rules, that can give employers and clients ownership of intellectual property rights in my work.  I am also aware that legal agreements I make [can transfer ownership of intellectual property rights in my work to others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(law)), such as companies and other organizations that I found, work for, or sell my work to.  I am aware that due to rules and agreements like these, I may not have the legal right to license work I create.

## Company and Client CLAs

If, before accepting one of my pull requests, a project steward asks me to help get a documented contributor license agreement from a company or other organization that might have the legal right to license my contribution, I promise to help the project steward request it.  I am aware that [only people with legal authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency) can sign CLAs on behalf of companies and other organizations.

## Reliability

I fully expect project stewards, users, and distributors of public software projects to rely on this CLA.  I am aware that they might enforce this CLA as a legally binding agreement.
